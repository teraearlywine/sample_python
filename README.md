# Sample Python Repository

Hello! 

Welcome to my Sample Python Repository.
Below you will find a directory containing very (very) basic python foundations practice. The sample python is really more of an ongoing practice arena for interview preparation, but also support more of the foundational computer science self-study I am doing. I have a fairly good handle on getting from point a to point b, even making code work better, but as leetcode and the last technical interview I completely botched will tell you, I could use some more practice.

This is in no way the limit to my python programming ability, I work more with API integrations and data engineering. This is to ensure I can articulate the foundational aspects as well. As time goes on I will likely refine the code, but feel free to take a look around. 

Best, 
Tera
